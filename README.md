# Pull Request Status Giphy Action

A GitHub Action that displays a random thumbs up or thumbs down gif from Giphy when all checks on a Pull Request complete.

It will automatically clean up an existing comment before making a new one if checks are re-run.

Works best when used in a workflow that runs on the `pull_request` event.
